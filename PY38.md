Python 3.8 Migration
====================

To install Python 3.8 using pyenv, run `pyenv install 3.8.0` with the latest pyenv source tree.

To install Backend.AI's dependencies on Python 3.8, you need to build many binary wheels until library
maintainers release new versions.

 * Most packages are automatically built by pip.  Note that `grpcio` takes quite a long time to build;
   grab a cup of coffee.
 * `psycopg2-binary`: `apt-get install libpq-dev` or `yum install postgresql-devel`

To run on Python 3.8, you need to use `asyncio` for the `event-loop` config variable in the respective
TOML files in both the manager and agent.

Also you need to patch the aiozmq manually (until we migrate to Callosum).
Edit the line 251 at `$(pyenv prefix)/lib/python3.8/site-packages/aiozmq/rpc/base.py` as follows:

```diff
  def add_pending(self, coro):
-     fut = asyncio.async(coro, loop=self.loop)
+     fut = asyncio.create_task(coro)
      self.pending_waiters.add(fut)
      return fut
```
